## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(120, 50%, 50%), a balanced green, translates to #40BF40. It's vibrant and approachable for a learning environment.
- Background color: HSL(120, 20%, 90%), a light and desaturated green, translates to #E0F2E0. This provides a soft, non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: HSL(90, 60%, 40%), a darker, more saturated green-yellow, translates to #66A626. It serves to highlight interactive elements without overwhelming the design.
- Font pairing: 'Literata' (serif) for headlines, 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. The former lends a slightly formal feel that implies the app has quality, while the latter maintains a modern readability.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for any instances of displayed code.
- Consistent use of flat design icons, green color, to match app's educational and friendly theme.
- Clean and intuitive design, mobile-first approach.
